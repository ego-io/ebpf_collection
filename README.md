# A collection of personal eBPF tools

What is it about ? so far it only contains [calltop](https://github.com/egobillot/calltop). I expect to write other tools related to eBPF. Time will tell.

## calltop
[calltop](https://github.com/egobillot/calltop) provides a lightweight real-time view of system calls and traces python function calls.
